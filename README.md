[Goodhart's Law](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodhart's_law) summarizes the state of modern upper-level education pretty well:

> When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.

`eedu`'s goal is be the most comprehensive way to make education more about learning and less worrying about grades.

To that end, it implements some features to (try) to make learning fun again:

- Manage what courses you are taking
- Automation for as much as possible, [when allowed](#auto-disclaimer).
- Give reliable and accurate grade statistics

> This project is still in development.
